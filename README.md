# Raze

> Raze for days.

## NOTICE: I am archiving this project. I have since built something even better which I've been using for a couple years (However, it isn't open sourced)

Raze is a lightweight HTTP framework with a focus on building APIs and containerized services. If you want a more general purpose framwork with static file serving, check out [Kemal](https://github.com/kemalcr/kemal).

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  raze:
    github: samueleaton/raze
```

## Usage

```ruby
require "raze"

get "/hello" do |ctx|
  "hello, world!"
end

Raze.run
```


Raze takes a modular-first approach to middlewares

```ruby
require "raze"

# Define middlewares
class Authenticator < Raze::Handler
  def call(ctx, done)
    puts "Authenticate here..."
    done.call
  end
end

class DDoSBlocker < Raze::Handler
  def call(ctx, done)
    puts "Prevent DDoS attack here..."
    done.call
  end
end

class UserFetcher < Raze::Handler
  def call(ctx, done)
    # Fetch user record from DB here...
    ctx.state["user_name"] = "Sam"
    done.call
  end
end

# Define routes, attach middlewares
get "/api/**", [Authenticator.new, DDoSBlocker.new]

get "/api/user/:user_id", UserFetcher.new do |ctx|
  "hello, #{ctx.state["user_name"]}!"
end

Raze.run
```

### TODO

####  Core

- [ ] Be able to run a stack of middlewares before the static file handler
- [ ] Remove all global scoping (e.g. `get "/"` -> `Raze.get "/"`)
- [ ] Live reload functionality for development
- [ ] Be able to define middlewares globally (for all routes)

#### Middlewares

- [ ] Urlencoded and JSON body parser
- [ ] Multipart/form-data body parser
- [ ] Static asset caching
  - should take a cache time interval and be able to take a path match regex
- [ ] Route caching
  - be able to cache the response for a route for a predetermined time interval
- [ ] Favicon caching
- [ ] CORS response header
- [ ] Access logger
- [ ] Session tracking
- [ ] Proxy middleware
- [ ] Security Headers
  - e.g. Node's [Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet)
